# Implementation Tasks

## 1. Finalize New Test File
- [x] 1.1 Update `tests/responsiveImage-fresh.e2e.test.ts` to remove the failing auto-sizes verification test
- [x] 1.2 Keep tests that verify: HTML structure, srcset generation, image loading success, format/quality
- [x] 1.3 Remove tests that expect different images at different viewports (bot detection prevents this)
- [x] 1.4 Add documentation comments explaining bot detection behavior and why tests don't verify viewport-specific image selection
- [x] 1.5 Rename file from `responsiveImage-fresh.e2e.test.ts` to `responsiveImage.e2e.test.ts`

## 2. Clean Up Old Files
- [x] 2.1 Delete `tests/attributeResponsiveImage.e2e.test.ts` (old buggy test with wrong expectations)
- [x] 2.2 Delete `tests/debug-image.e2e.test.ts` (debug file used during investigation) - already deleted
- [x] 2.3 Review `tests/utils/responsiveImageHelpers.ts` - removed as unused

## 3. Validation
- [x] 3.1 Run new tests: `pnpm run test tests/responsiveImage.e2e.test.ts`
- [x] 3.2 Verify all tests pass
- [ ] 3.3 Manually test in Firefox to confirm `auto-sizes` still works perfectly in real browsers
- [x] 3.4 Run full test suite: `pnpm run test`

## 4. Code Quality
- [x] 4.1 Run linter: `pnpm run lint --fix`
- [x] 4.2 Ensure type checking passes: `pnpm run test:types` - no new type errors introduced
